Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma are inflammatory chronic conditions that affect the respiratory system. It is estimated that 1 million people suffer from COPD worldwide and 300 million from asthma with the numbers showing growth trends for the next few years. COPD and asthma cost £800 million and £3.7 billion correspondingly in the NHS, putting a significant strain on the healthcare sector. 

This report accompanies two interactive dashboards for COPD and asthma for two distinct stakeholder groups; citizens and executives. It has been structured to emphasize how the development stages of visualization tools are inextricably linked to the audiences’ expectations, drawing evidence from the literature and personal experience. 
Two different approaches of dashboards are commented:

	- the first focuses on citizens’ requirements and highlights the impact of air quality and smoking on COPD and asthma hospital readmissions; 
	- the second focuses on executive’s requirements, underlining prescription costs of asthma and COPD around England and showing that the 
North is the most problematic region with prescription costs for 2012 over £197 million. 

The dashboards have been developed using free of charge, population data from the NHS Digital and other governmental sources.
The main axes on which this report has been structured are a critical appraisal of the existed health data landscape in the UK and on the potential impact of agile methodology in data science projects; data pre-processing techniques; deterministic data linkage; and data visualization principles on quality and usability of such tools.  

Identification of strengths, risks and recommendations complete the narrative that is supported by real-world examples and illustrative graphs.
